- A promise has 3 states. They are:

Pending: You don't know if you will get that phone
Fulfilled: Mom is happy, she buys you a brand new phone
Rejected: Your mom is happy, she withholds the phone

- Promises are Asynchronous

- With ES6 we can use => not function()
- With ES7 we can use async and await without .then and .catch

- We use promises when need wait the response, for example:
1. Calling APIs
2. Downloading files
3. Reading files
